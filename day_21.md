Today is my twenty first day in internship, jaswanth came me and asked how was day going, then i said ya fine with my admin work after that he asked about any dout with you sathish, then i asked yestreday kouchick teached about function aray/list  in that what is aray and objective, then he told first you searched in google after that you didn't understood that you said to me , then i will teach you after that jaswanth said what are all teached in session daily you tryit sathish , if you try it daily you can easly understood that okay , then i saod okay jaswanth after that lunch time we all had lunch and went out after that read extream ownership book and in that book, but find some words in google bocome some of words didn't understood that, then we wrote in terminal after that session meeting started in second floor then we all went to second flood koushick start teaching about this week what are all studyed like in programming language * symbols, token, expression, keywords after that * data type= string, int, bool, float, double, function, objects, aray, list and what is data type and what is define into about type of idn after that *simple and composite * syntax= rules of follow, semanticsis a meaning then he said any key is cannot be deplated [unique]. After that he teached about compiler in compiler they have machine language what is machine language? a language used for computer programs in which instructions are written in the form of numbers so that a computer can understand and act on them is called as machine languages. This contact in that like lexical analysis, syntactical analysis, semantic analysis, then only code generation this is a machine language {EXAMPLE }for it also like string a = "surfbard"; string- keywords, a- idn, = - operation assiging operator, " - puntuator, surfboard- value[idn] " - puntuator, ; - puntuator this are all meaning in complier in machine language is 0,1 using the compiler, in machine languages- 010101010101011100, assembly level language- add, sub, div, mul, mv, 0101110, programming languages- string a = "surfboard" using in complier after that in code we should rember that DRY  is the meaning of Donot Repeat Yourself important think for the code this are all doning in this day after that we do the admin work they we fineshed that and left office....
